# Instructions

The `slides.md` file contains the slides for a given month of the Tokyo iOS Meetup.

## Adding to the Slides

The `slides.md` on the master branch contains the template to be used for any new meetup. 

If there are any new slides which should be added to all future meetups, then they should be added to the slides.md file on the master branch.

## Creating Slides for a Given Meetup

Slides for a specific meetup should be created on a seperate git branch.  So to make a copy of the slides for an upcoming meetup.

1. Checkout the latest copy of the master branch.
2. Check a new branch with the date of next meetup in the format yyyy-mm-dd (so the meetup on October 17, 2015 will have the branch name 2015-10-17).
3. Make any changes to add specific content for that meetup.
4. Commit the changes.
5. Push the new branch to the github repository.
